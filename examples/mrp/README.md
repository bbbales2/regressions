The model, data cleaning code, and `statelevel_predictors.csv` file come from the
[Multilevel Regression and Poststratification Case Studies](https://bookdown.org/jl5522/MRP-case-studies/)
([Github](https://github.com/JuanLopezMartin/MRPCaseStudy)).

You'll need to download the CCES data from the CCES Dataverse [here](`https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3588803?format=original&gbrecs=true`) and place it in this folder as `cces18_common_vv.csv`.

To run the model do:

```bash
python clean.py
rat 
```
